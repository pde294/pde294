### Hi Everyone, welcome to pde294's github profile! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 2021 Bootcamp grad who is in the process of looking for a new role where I can utilize my data analytics skills. I am interested in leveraging data to help solve problems in a way that is cognizant of the "human" aspect of the customer/participant experience. I have seen how data that is rigorously collected and analyzed can help us to understand each other better, and create solutions that can be continuously improved upon. In other words, I'm a big believer that data can change the world for the good!
